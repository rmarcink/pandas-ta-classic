cdl_doji.__doc__ = """Candle Type: Doji

A candle body is Doji, when it is no longer than 10% of the
average of the 10 previous candles' high-low range.

Sources:
    TA-Lib: CDLDOJI, bar for bar. Other ``length`` and ``factor`` values
    match TA-Lib with its BodyDoji setting changed to
    (HighLow, length, factor / 100).

Calculation:
    Default values:
        length=10, factor=10 (0.1), scalar=100
    ABS = Absolute Value
    TOTAL = running sum of HL_RANGE over the previous length bars,
        seeded left to right and updated as TA-Lib does

    BODY = ABS(close - open)
    HL_RANGE = ABS(high - low)

    DOJI = scalar IF BODY <= (factor / 100) * (TOTAL / length) ELSE 0

Args:
    open_ (pd.Series): Series of 'open's
    high (pd.Series): Series of 'high's
    low (pd.Series): Series of 'low's
    close (pd.Series): Series of 'close's
    length (int): The period. Default: 10
    factor (float): Doji value, as a percent of the high-low range. Default: 10
    scalar (float): How much to magnify. Default: 100
    asint (bool): Keep results numerical instead of boolean. Default: True

Kwargs:
    naive (bool, optional): If True, the first ``length`` finite bars,
        which have no window of previous bars, are compared with
        ``factor`` percent of their own high-low range instead of
        reporting 0. Default: False
    fillna (value, optional): pd.DataFrame.fillna(value)
    fill_method (value, optional): Type of fill method

Returns:
    pd.Series: CDL_DOJI column.
